# MealPlan Maker

**MealPlan Maker** is a tiny Python program to create your **weekly meal plan**.  

This project is designed to help you plan your meals for the week easily, based on your recipes.

## 📝 Requirements

This program requires a **recipes file** in `.rtk` format:

- The file should be named `recipes.rtk`
- It should contain all your recipes in the expected format with the right tags 
- Place it in the root directory of the project before running the program

Without this file, the program **will not run**.
